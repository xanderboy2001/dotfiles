# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for varios tools and environments. I manage these files using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to easily symlink them into their proper locations.

Currently included configurations:

- **fish**
- **git**
- **github**
- **neovim**
- **starship**
- **zellij**

## Prerequisites

Before setting up, ensure the following tools are installed on your machine:

- **git**
- **GNU Stow**
- The applications for which you have dotfiles (e.g. fish, neovim, hyprland, zellij, starship)

You can install GNU stow on most Linux systems with:

```bash
sudo pacman -S stow				# Arch
sudo apt install stow			# Debian/Ubuntu
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xanderboy2001/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
```

2. **Use Stow to deploy dotfiles**
Each folder in the repository corresponds to a package you can deploy. For example:
```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles

# Deploy all dotfiles
stow fish <app-name>
```
This will symlink each configuration file to the appropriate location in your home directory.

3. **Verify configuration**
- Open a new shell to ensure fish is using your configuration.
- Start `nvim` or `zellij` to confirm the configurations are applied
- For Hyprland and Starship, ensure the applications pick up the new configs on start.

## Adding New Dotfiles
To add a new application configuration:
1. Create a folder with the application name:
```bash
mkdir ~/.dotfiles/<app-name>
```
2. Place the configuration files in that folder, preserving the directory structure relative to `$HOME`. For example, if a file normally goes in `~/.config/app/config.toml`, place it as:
```bash
dotfiles/<app-name>/.config/app/config.toml
```
3. Stow the new configuration:
```bash
stow <app-name>
```


---


## Updating Dotfiles
To update your dotfiles on a machine with the latest changes:
```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
git pull
stow -R <app-name>
```
The `-R` flag re-stows existing configurations to apply any updates
